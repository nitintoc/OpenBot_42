Interact with a text file using an ai agent with this project

Why I created this project?
One can upload any text file and interact with it using llm locally on one's system. 
This ensure better privacy than doing the same on similar online tools.

The LLM used for this is : Llama
You can install the open source version of llama to run on your system here : https://ollama.com/download 

Future extensions:
Modularization of the file
